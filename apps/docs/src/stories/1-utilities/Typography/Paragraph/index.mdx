# Paragraph (P)

<Source language="jsx" code="import { P } from '@rypak/ui'" />

## Overview

The `P` component is a fundamental typography element used for paragraph text in
the design system. It provides consistent styling and proper semantics for
blocks of text, ensuring readability and accessibility across the application.

The `P` component:

- Renders as a semantic `<p>` HTML element
- Maintains consistent typographic styles
- Supports various text sizes and weights
- Can be customized with different colors and alignments
- Ensures proper text spacing and readability

## Examples

### Sizes

#### Extra Small

<Canvas of={Stories.ExtraSmall} />

#### Small (Default)

<Canvas of={Stories.Small} />

#### Medium

<Canvas of={Stories.Medium} />

#### Large

<Canvas of={Stories.Large} />

## Design Guidelines

- Use the `P` component for all paragraph text to maintain consistency
- Maintain adequate contrast between text and background colors (minimum 4.5:1
  for normal text)
- Avoid using very small text sizes that could make content difficult to read
- Use appropriate line height to ensure readability, especially for longer
  blocks of text
- Consider text alignment based on context (left-aligned is typically best for
  paragraphs)

## UI Copy

- Keep paragraphs concise and focused on a single idea
- Use simple, clear language that is easy to understand
- Avoid using all caps, excessive bold, or italic for paragraph text
- Break long blocks of text into smaller, digestible paragraphs
- Maintain a consistent tone of voice throughout the application

## Accessibility

- The `P` component uses the semantic `<p>` HTML element, which helps screen
  readers identify paragraph content
- Text size can be adjusted to meet accessibility standards (minimum 16px for
  body text is recommended)
- Line height and letter spacing are optimized for readability, including for
  users with dyslexia or visual impairments
- Color contrast meets WCAG AA standards (4.5:1 for normal text)
- Text remains accessible when users increase their browser's font size

## API

### Usage

```jsx
import { P } from '@rypak/ui';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <P size="md">
      This is a paragraph of text that demonstrates the P component.
    </P>
  );
}
```

## Properties

The `P` component extends:

- All HTML paragraph element attributes
  (`React.HTMLAttributes<HTMLParagraphElement>`)
- All Panda CSS styled component properties

<ArgTypes of={Stories} />

## Caveats and Limitations

- Extremely long words might cause layout issues in responsive designs
- Custom styling may override default accessibility features and should be used
  carefully
- Font rendering may vary slightly across different browsers and operating
  systems
- For text that requires specific semantic meaning beyond paragraphs, consider
  using other typography components
