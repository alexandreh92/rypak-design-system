# Typography

The typography utility provides a set of classes for controlling the font size,
weight, and line height of text elements. It is designed to be used in
conjunction with other utility classes to create a consistent and visually
appealing typographic hierarchy.

<Source language="jsx" code="import { Typography } from '@rypak/ui'" />
