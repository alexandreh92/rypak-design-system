# Heading (H1, H2, H3, H4)

<Source language="jsx" code="import { H1, H2, H3, H4 } from '@rypak/ui'" />

## Overview

Headings are typographic elements used to create a clear hierarchy of content on
a page. They help users navigate through content and understand the relationship
between different sections.

The Heading components include four levels:

- `H1`: Main page title, used once per page
- `H2`: Section titles
- `H3`: Subsection titles
- `H4`: Minor subsection titles

Each heading component automatically applies the correct font size, weight, line
height, and margins to maintain consistent typography across the application.

## Examples

### H1 - Primary Heading

<Canvas of={Stories.H1Story} />

### H2 - Secondary Heading

<Canvas of={Stories.H2Story} />

### H3 - Tertiary Heading

<Canvas of={Stories.H3Story} />

### H4 - Quaternary Heading

<Canvas of={Stories.H4Story} />

## Design Guidelines

- Use headings to create a clear content hierarchy
- Include only one H1 per page to represent the main page title
- Maintain hierarchical order (H1 → H2 → H3 → H4) without skipping levels
- Keep headings concise and descriptive
- Avoid using headings for styling purposes only
- Ensure sufficient contrast between heading text and background

## UI Copy

- Keep headings concise (ideally under 8 words)
- Use sentence case for all headings
- Avoid using punctuation at the end of headings
- Don't use all caps or excessive formatting (bold, italic) within headings
- Ensure headings accurately describe the content that follows

## Accessibility

- Proper heading structure is essential for screen reader navigation
- Users can navigate between headings using keyboard shortcuts
- Maintain hierarchical structure (don't skip levels) for better screen reader
  experience
- Do not use heading elements solely for styling purposes
- Ensure sufficient color contrast (WCAG AA 4.5:1 for normal text, 3:1 for large
  text)
- Headings can be targeted with ARIA landmarks for enhanced navigation

## API

### Usage

```jsx
import { H1, H2, H3, H4 } from '@rypak/ui';

function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <H1>Page Title</H1>
      <section>
        <H2>Section Title</H2>
        <p>Section content goes here.</p>

        <H3>Subsection Title</H3>
        <p>Subsection content goes here.</p>

        <H4>Minor Subsection</H4>
        <p>Minor subsection content goes here.</p>
      </section>
    </div>
  );
}
```

### Properties

<ArgTypes of={Stories} />

Each heading component accepts all standard HTML attributes for the `<h1>`,
`<h2>`, `<h3>`, and `<h4>` elements respectively.

### Caveats and Limitations

- Avoid overriding the font-family, as it's a core part of the design system's
  typography
- While you can customize the appearance with className or style props, maintain
  sufficient contrast and readability
- For SEO and accessibility reasons, there should only be one H1 per page
- Excessive customization may lead to inconsistent UI across the application
